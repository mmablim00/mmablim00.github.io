    "The COVID-19 pandemic has truly served as a transformative historical event in the 21st century. The pandemic has led to the dramatic loss of human life around the world. Additionally, many aspects of life and human behavior have been forced to change due to the restrictions and limitations COVID-19 has brought forth. The food service industry, retail, educational institutions, and healthcare have all been challenged and threatened enourmously. Periodic lockdowns and enforced quarantines have resulted in loss of income, economic assests, and employment in general for millions. When livelihoods become endangered to the extent like they have in this pandemic, immense feelings of desperation and hopelessness become frequent. For this reason, it becomes worthwhile to ask if this pandemic and all of its challenges have impacted criminal activitiy.    \n",

    "In this project, we will attempt to present and uncover a correlation between the pandemic and criminal activity in the city of College Park, Maryland. We will do so by analyzing crime data between two time periods. The first time period being the entire year of 2019 to March 2020 (pre-pandemic), and the second time period being April of 2020 onwards (pandemic).     "

    "To collect the neccessary data for this project, we will scrape the University of Maryland, College Park Police Department website: http://www.umpd.umd.edu/stats/incident_logs.cfm. Because the website organizes the data by year and month, we will use python's requests module to retrieve the HTML that corresponds to the page for each month in a year. Afterwards, we will use the BeautifulSoup library to to find the html for the table that contains the data for each month. We will then concatenate each month's data to make a dataframe for each year. Because we are comparing crime between pre-pandemic and during the pandemic, we will only use the data from 2019 to 2020. Yearly data is then stored in a dictionary, with the year (2019 or 2020) acting as the key and the corresponding dataframes for each year serving as the values.  \n",

    "As can be seen above, data scraping does not give ideally formatted or \"clean\" data, due to how the website and html stores data. The main problem is that each case is listed twice in the dataframe, with the location of the case being listed 5 times in the 2nd entry and there being a column named \"Unnamed: 5\". Additonally, the way we have divided our data in terms of year does not really make sense either. We have two dataframes for crime data for 2019 and 2020, since we want to be comparing data pre-pandemic and during the pandemic, it makes more sense if we change these two dataframes so that they reflect the actual periods of time that constitute life before the pandemic and life during the pandemic. For the purposes of this project, we are going to consider 2019 to before March 2020 as pre-pandemic and March 2020 onwards as the pandemic. In this section we will tidy up the data, reformat it for our convenience, and deal with all NaN or missing values."

Note that for the first 2 months, Janurary and Feburary, we don't expect to see a rise since the effects of the Pandemic haven't hit the United States at this time. We'll be treating it more as a base case to see if there's any inital differences between 2019 and 2020. After, starting with the comparison between March 2019 and March 2020 is when we'll test for our hypothesis since March 2020 is around the time the pandemic started to affect the United States. \n",
